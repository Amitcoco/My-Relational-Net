# My Internal Net - Interactive Concept Map

An interactive 2D concept map that visualizes the interconnected themes from design, animation, interaction, and personal life. Built with visual and emotional logic rather than taxonomic organization.

## Features

### Visual Design
- **Nodes**: Circular elements representing concepts, positioned in loose clusters
- **Connections**: Three distinct relationship styles:
  - **Solid lines**: "influences" or "enables" relationships
  - **Dashed lines**: "contrasts" or "obscures" relationships  
  - **Arrowed lines**: "evolves into" or "accelerates" relationships

### Interactions
- **Click a node**: Highlights the selected node and its directly connected nodes, fades the rest
- **Drag nodes**: Freely reposition concepts to explore new arrangements
- **Breathing animation**: All nodes gently scale (95%-105%) over 4 seconds every 8 seconds
- **Springy motion**: Smooth, physical-feeling interactions

### Concept Themes
The map includes concepts from:
- **Design & Animation**: Frame-by-frame, hand-drawn, procedural, pixel art
- **Interaction**: Feedback loops, affordances, emergence
- **Creative Process**: Sketching, documentation, iteration, imperfection
- **Personal Elements**: Bicycles, literature, nature, water
- **Philosophical**: Memory, abstraction, system thinking

## How to Use

1. **Open `index.html`** in a modern web browser
2. **Click on any node** to see its relationships highlighted
3. **Drag nodes** to rearrange the map and explore new connections
4. **Watch the breathing animation** that occurs every 8 seconds
5. **Click outside nodes** to deselect and return to the full view

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses SVG for smooth, scalable connections
- CSS animations for breathing effects
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- No external dependencies required

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - Visual styling and animations
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality and concept data
- `README.md` - This documentation

## Relationship Types

The concept map uses three visual relationship styles to express different types of connections:

1. **Solid lines** represent positive, enabling relationships
2. **Dashed lines** represent contrasting or obscuring relationships  
3. **Arrowed lines** represent evolutionary or accelerating relationships

This creates a rich network of interconnected ideas that can be explored through interaction and observation.
